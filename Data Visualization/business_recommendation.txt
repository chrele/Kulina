Business Recommendation:

The cohort analysis shows that new users registered by the end of the year are declining in numbers compared to the early months of the year. For this, a promotional event to attract new customers to join Kulina can be held on the end of the years, for example on November or December.

The graph also shows that Kulina lost more than 60% in averager of its customer after the one month. The number of retained customers continues to decline over time. To solve this problem, a reward program based on the users activity can be created. The users will receive benefits if they uses Kulina services for several periods in a row. Kulina can also tries to improve their customer services by being ready 24/7 for any complaints or questions as well as monitor Kulina's partner to make sure that their cooked meals are ready to be delivered to the customer on the specified time and monitor Kulina's courier to make sure that the cooked meals from the partners can be delivered as soon as possible to Kulina users.
